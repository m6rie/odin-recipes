    <h4>these easy lasagna stuffed burritos are a family favourite! stuffed with lasagna meat sauce, lasagna flavours, and plenty of melted mozzarella cheese!
    </h4>
    <p>Welcome to lazy persons lasagna 101. This is a recipe I created many years ago, when we’ve all been craving lasagna, but I haven’t have the time to layer, or wait around your oven for half an hour to an hour. This is a 10-15 minute lasagna, without the effort — or the pasta. And you don’t miss the pasta when lasagna meat is enveloped in fluffy tortillas.
    </p>
    <p>Making these again this last weekend for the zillionth time, my family were ALL OVER ME to post these. I googled and googled and found so many BURRITO LASAGNA’S (as in, layers of burritos in lasagna-style assembling), but NO lasagna stuffed inside a burrito. Am I really the only one that does this?    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <h5>Burritos</h5>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion , diced</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic , minced</li>
        <li>1 pound (500 grams) ground lean beef</li>
        <li>12 ounces (350 grams) ground sausage</li>
        <li>21 ounces (600 grams) bottle tomato puree / sauce, or passata (or marinara sauce), divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons beef bouillon powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper , to taste</li>
        <li>Pinch of dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch of dried basil</li>
        <li>6-8 large tortilla wraps (white or while wheat)</li>
        <li>7 ounces (200 grams) fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        

        <h5>White sauce (optional)</h5>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter , chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all purpose or plain flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        Preheat oven to broil or grill settings on medium heat. Lightly spray a baking sheet / tray with cooking oil spray; set aside.
    </ol>

    <h5>Meat sauce</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan or skillet. Sauté onions and garlic until translucent and fragrant over low-medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add in the ground beef and sausage; fry until browned, while breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in 3/4 of the tomato puree. Add the tomato paste, bouillon powder, salt and pepper (to taste), and dried herbs. Bring to a simmer until sauce thickens. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly (the sauce will be thicker than normal lasagne sauce to avoid wetting and ripping the tortillas).</li>
        <li>While cooling, prepare white sauce (optional)</li>

    </ol>
    <h5>White sauce (optional)</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour; cook, quickly stirring for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually add milk, starting with 1/4 cup, whisking constantly, until mixture is smooth. Return to a low heat and cook, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, for about 10 minutes, or until sauce thickens and comes to a boil. (It should coat the back of a wooden spoon.) Remove from heat.</li>        
    </ol>
    <h5>Assemble</h5>
    <li>Heat tortillas in microwave for one minute until soft. Place two slices of mozzarella onto the tortilla; spread about 1/4 cup of meat on each tortilla, and top with 2 more slices of mozzarella. Fold over tortilla ends, and roll up. Pour remaining tomato puree/sauce over the top (about 2 tablespoons each burrito), spoon white sauce over the tomato sauce, and top with the shredded mozzarella. Place burritos on prepared baking sheet / tray; bake burritos until cheese has melted and the tortillas are golden. Serve immediately.</li>

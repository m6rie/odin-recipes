        <h4>Easy crisp-tender chicken with the creamiest lemon butter sauce ever – you’ll want to forget the chicken and drink the sauce instead!</h4>
        <p>Happy New Year! I know I should really be sharing some sort of salad or quinoa recipe with the start of the year but you know me and my chicken thigh obsession. I just can’t get enough, especially when a lemon butter cream sauce is involved.</p>
        <p>And if you’re in the need of some clean greens for the new year diet, well, this dish has plenty of baby spinach. Good enough, right?</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>2 cups baby spinach, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs with paprika, salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side; drain excess fat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, heavy cream, Parmesan, lemon juice and thyme.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat, stir in spinach, and simmer until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has slightly thickened, about 3-5 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Place into oven and roast until completely cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>

        </ol>
